These python scripts process the simulated psfs generated by Carlos.

1) Edit the start of reshape_fits.py to point it to the locations of the fits files, and tell it the simulation parameters for each case.
2) Run reshape_fits.py to reshape the simulated psfs into 4D fits files and save them.
3) Run plot_parameters.py to read the 4D fits files and produce plots of the psfs, FWHM, strehl, and EE50.

The initial round of simulateds psfs are available on the google drive, under Keck > KAPA > Performance Simulations > KAPA_PDF_PSFs
The simulation parameters are described in KAON 1371
